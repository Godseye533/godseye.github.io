        <p><b>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</b> <big>is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</big>
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</br><strong>HOW  IT SPREADS:</strong></br>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
            <small>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19,</small>  or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
